            <li>Mix 125 grams of flour with the yeast, sugar, and salt. Then add 10ml of oil and 175ml
                of warm water(Ideally 45&#8451;) and stir it with a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>Gradually add other 125 grams of flour and more as you needed. Keep stirring until the 
                dough is forming into a elastic ball and can be handle with your hands.
            </li>
            <li>Form your dough into a ball and transfer it to a bowl with spread olive oil. Wrap
                your bowl with plastic paper and let it rest cover from cold for 45 minutes. </li>

            <li>Spread your tomato sauce on top of the pizza and finish it by adding cheese and 
                your selected toppings. Put your pizza in the pre-heated oven for approximately 15 minutes
